This is a Streamlit application that uses [SimplyGoPy](https://github.com/TheDJVG/SimplyGoPy) to calculate the total amount spent for a set of transactions in a given date range. 

To start the app locally, clone this repo and [install Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation), then run it with ```streamlit run simplytotal.py```.

Comments and contributions always welcome! 

# Why this exists
SimplyGo lets you retrieve transactions from a specific date range, but doesn't help you add them up. I was adding up my expenditure manually for a while before I finally got off my arse and realised that someone had made a Python package to interact with SimplyGo.

There's supposedly a "Monthly Statistics" feature, but it isn't working for me :(
